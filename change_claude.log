## Error Investigation - 2025-07-28

### Issues Found:

1. **401 error on /api/user endpoint** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: Missing or expired Kick.com access_token cookie
   - This is expected behavior when user is not authenticated
   - Location: src/pages/api/user.ts:26

2. **500 error on /api/LuxdropProxy endpoint** - IDENTIFIED
   - Root cause: Required environment variables are commented out in .env.local
   - Missing variables: LUXDROP_LEADERBOARD_CODES, LUXDROP_API_KEY, BASE_LUXDROP_API_URL
   - Location: src/pages/api/LuxdropProxy.ts:20-27

3. **Multiple Supabase client instances warning** - PENDING
   - Warning about multiple GoTrueClient instances in same browser context
   - May cause undefined behavior with concurrent usage

### Next Steps:
- User needs to configure Luxdrop environment variables with actual values
- Investigate Supabase client instantiation to prevent multiple instances
